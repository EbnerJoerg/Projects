# Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table
This is a competition on DrivenData to predict the operating condition of a waterpoint in Tansania. The data stems from Taarifa waterpoints dashboard, which aggregates data from the Tanzania Ministry of Water. Around 47% of all inhabitants in Tansania suffer from water scarcity. The main goal of this project is to support Tansanian government in detecting non-functional water pumps.
